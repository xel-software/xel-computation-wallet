A light wallet version for those who want to use and trade XEL coin before the final (computable) version is ready.

This software is highly experimental and may contain unknown bugs.
By using this software you clearly state that you are using the software at your own risk.
This means, that nobody else except you is liable for any kinds of losses that are connected to XEL, it's implementation, the protocol design or anything similar.
Especially, XEL is not meant to be speculative or used as any kind of storage of value; if you act differently you do it at your own risk anyway.

If you do not accept this disclaimer
or if you live in a jurisdiction where running a cryptocurrency
or if you live in a jurisdiction where using cryptography
or if you live in a jurisdiction where any other part of XEL might be illegal (or not explicitly allowed)
or if you live in a jurisdiction where this disclaimer does not have 100% validity
then you are not allowed to proceed and use Elastic at all.

The following bugfixes have been applied between 16. and 18. September 2018:

BUG1:

Severity: LOW
Affects Consensus / Requires Fork: NO
Description:

When nodes sync many blocks because they have been offline for a while, they typically receive blocks (and their transactions) in blobs, i.e., multiple blocks and transactions at one.
The transaction signatures have been checked multiple times, once when receiving the blocks, and again when the blocks are actually applied to the blockchain (in order).

Now, redeem transactions require adding a public key announcement if the address has not been seen on the blockchain to correctly verify the redeem signature - otherwise not.
However, when signatures were checked for transactions in a blob of blocks during initial sync, it was possible that there were both,
first a (different) public key announcement and then a redeem transaction without (a redundant) publickey announcement.
However, since none of the transaction were applied yet, the second "redeem" transaction check failed and caused honest nodes to be disconnected.

The fix was to remove the signature checks during parseTransaction():

https://github.com/xel-software/Litewallet-Mainnet/commit/779615aaad4a763ed76bbdbae1835bcbc5eb86ac

This is safe to do, because transaction signature are still checked:
a) when including a block in the blockchain: BlockchainProcessorImpl.java Line 1555 (validateTransactions())
b) when receiving an unconfirmed transaction: TransactionProcessorImpl.java Line Line 686 (processTransaction())


BUG2:

Severity: LOW
Affects Consensus / Requires Fork: NO

The warning, that you are on a fork relied simply on checking how much "staking power" miners are having.
However, when only very few people are staking, the staking power is fairly low which caused the warning "You are on a fork" to appear and giving false alarms.

It is false to rely on the staking power to guess whether you are on a fork or not. For now, we have applied a little fix:

https://github.com/xel-software/Litewallet-Mainnet/commit/f9d866bc85c2122ba54ae9a5d6a16e20244acdab

Which simply assume now, that when no block was found for more than an hour, a fork must have occured, splitting you off the network while the rest proceeds.
Better metrics are appreciated. Everyone is encouraged to submit a suggestion or a pull request.
For high security application, it may be advised to cross check the latest blocks with other sources that you trust (other nodes of you or the block explorer)!

Furthermore, in this commit:
https://github.com/xel-software/Litewallet-Mainnet/commit/17baa92bdf1b45065311846e3f26373acfe54bef

We require 3 fork confirmations instead of only 2, which only switches to a different fork (from active to orphan block) when at least 3 other nodes that you are connected to confirm to be on the same fork.
